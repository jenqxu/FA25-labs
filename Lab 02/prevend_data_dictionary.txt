prevend dataset
Description
Data from the Prevention of REnal and Vascular END-stage Disease (PREVEND) study, which took place in the Netherlands. The study collected various demographic and cardiovascular risk factors. This dataset is from the third survey, which participants completed in 2003-2006; data is provided for 4,095 individuals who completed cognitive testing.

Usage
data(statins)
Format
A data frame with 4095 observations on the following 31 variables.

Casenr
case number, numberic

Age
age in years, recorded at time of enrollment.

Gender
Numeric vector: 0 = males; 1 = females.

Ethnicity
Numeric vector: 0 = Western European; 1 = African; 2 = Asian; 3 = Other.

Education
Highest level of education. Numeric: 0 primary school; 1 = lower secondary education; 3 = university.

RFFT
Performance on the Ruff Figural Fluency Test. Scores range from 0 (worst) to 175 (best).

VAT
Visual Association Test score. The VAT is a learning task based on image recognition. Scores may range from 0 (worst) to 12 (best)

CVD
History of cardiovascular event. Numeric vector: 0 = No; 1 = Yes.

DM
Diabetes mellitus status at enrollment. Numeric vector: 0 = No; 1 = Yes.

Smoking
Smoking at enrollment. numeric vector: 0 = No; 1 = Yes.

Hypertension
status of hypertension at enrollment. Numeric vector: 0 = No; 1 = Yes.

BMI
Body mass index, in kg/m^2

SBP
Systolic blood pressure, in mmHg

DBP
Diastolic blood pressure, in mmHg

MAP
Mean arterial pressure, in mmHg

eGFR
Estimated glomerular filtration rate, a measure of kidney function. Low values indicate possible kidney damage, in mL/min.

Albuminuria.1
Albuminuria (mg/24hr) in two categories. Numeric vector: 0 = (< 30); 1 = (
≥
≥ 30)

Albuminuria.2
Albuminuria (mg/24hr) in three categories. Numeric: 0 = (0 to < 10), 1 = (10 to < 30); 3 = (
≥
≥ 30).

Chol
Total cholesterol, in mmol/L.

HDL
HDL cholesterol, in mmol/L.

Statin
Statin use at enrollment. Numeric vector: 0 = No; 1 = Yes.

Solubility
Statin solubility. Numeric vector: 0 = lipophilic; 1 = hydrophilic; 2 = no statin use. NA is used for statin users for whom solubility of the statin is missing.

Days
Total duration of statin use, in days.

Years
Total duration of statin use, in years.

DDD
Defined daily dose of the statin. Numeric vector: From the PLOS One paper, "DDD is defined by the WHO as the drug units representing dosages with approximately similar efficacy. One DDD corresponds to the following dosage for each statin respectively: Simvastatin 30 mg, Pravastatin 30 mg, Fluvastatin 60 mg, Atorvastatin 20 mg and Rosuvastatin 10 mg."

FRS
Framingham risk score. Numeric vector. The score, a measure of risk for a cardivascular event within 10 years. Higher values imply increased use. For details see D’Agostino RBS, Vasan RS, Pencina MJ, Wolf PA, Cobain M, et al. (2008) General cardiovascular risk profile for use in primary care: The framingham heart study. Circulation 117: 743–753.

PS
Propensity score of statin use. Numeric vector. See the PLOS One paper for the model used to calculate the score

PSquint
Quintile of PS. Numeric vector.

GRS
Indicator for random sample of 1638 Groningen residents in the study. Numeric vector.

Match_1
Statin users and non-users matched 1:1 on age and educational level. Matched pairs share a common integer label. Numeric vector.

Match_2
Statin users and non-users matched 1:1 on Framingham risk score. Matched pairs share a common integer label. Numeric vector.

Details
Original study design described in Joosten, van Eersel, et. al. Description of propensity score matching may be found in the Joosten, Visser et. al referemce. Background on the RFFT may be found in the Izaks reference.
